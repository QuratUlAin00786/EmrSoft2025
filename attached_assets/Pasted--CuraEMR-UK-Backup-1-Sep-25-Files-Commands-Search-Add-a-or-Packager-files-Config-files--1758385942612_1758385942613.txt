I've updated the flag creation system to also update the patient's risk level. Can you test creating a flag with different severities (like "Medium" or "High") and confirm that the patient's risk level changes accordingly in the patient list?

I've successfully updated the Patient Flags section in the patient.tsx file: 1. **Changed the background color**: Added a light gray background (`bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800`) with padding and rounded corners to make the "Patient Flags" section more visually distinct. 2. **Positioning confirmed**: The "Patient Flags" section is already positioned after the "Allergies" section as requested. The Patient Flags section now has a subtle light background that will help distinguish it from other sections in the patient summary view. The changes are minimal and focused exactly on what you requested - just the background styling of the flag type section.

Perfect! I've successfully made both changes you requested: ## Changes Made: 1. **Updated Patient Flags background to white**: Changed the background color from gray to white with a subtle border to make it more visible 2. **Moved Patient Flags before Records button**: The Patient Flags section now appears prominently before the Records and Book buttons in the patient cards ## Results: - **Background**: Patient Flags now have a clean white background with a light border - **Positioning**: Flags are displayed right before the Records/Book buttons, making them more prominent and visible - **Functionality**: All flag operations continue to work correctly (creation, deletion, risk level updates) The logs show that the flag system is working properly - flags are being created with different severities, risk levels are updating accordingly (from "low" to "critical" based on flag severity), and the real-time updates are functioning through the cache system. The Patient Flags section now has better visual prominence with the white background and strategic placement before the action buttons, making important patient information more noticeable for healthcare staff.

Perfect! ✅ I've successfully removed the flag type display that was appearing at the top of patient cards after the "critical" badge. ## Changes Made: - **Removed top flag display**: The flag types (🚩 High Risk, 🚩 Medical Alert, etc.) are no longer shown after the critical badge at the top of patient cards - **Kept flag display before Records button**: The flag types still appear in their intended location right before the Records and Book buttons ## Results: - **Cleaner Header**: Patient card headers now only show the critical badge without duplicate flag information - **Single Flag Location**: Flag types now only appear in one location - before the Records button where they're most useful - **Working System**: The logs confirm all flag operations continue to work correctly (creation, deletion, risk level updates) The patient cards now have a cleaner appearance without the duplicate flag display, exactly as requested. The flag system maintains full functionality with flags appearing only in the optimal location before the action buttons.

I understand! You want to display the actual patient names instead of just showing "Patient" as a label in the Clinical Photos tab. Let me find where this is happening and fix it by looking up the patient details using the patient ID.

🩺 1. File: client/src/components/appointments/doctor-appointments.tsx

Task:

First, check if the logged-in user’s role is 'doctor'.

When a doctor clicks the "Cancel Appointment" button:

A modal popup should open.

The modal must have two buttons:

Delete → deletes the appointment.

Cancel → closes the modal.

After deleting, the data should auto-refresh (e.g., update the list without manual reload).

Keep everything else in the file as it is (don’t modify layout, styles, or unrelated logic).

🕒 2. File: shifts.tsx

Task:

Check if the logged-in user’s role is 'admin'.

When the admin goes to the "Default Shifts" tab and clicks "Initialize Default Shifts",

The system should create default shifts for 24/7 (i.e., always available).

Keep all other logic and layout unchanged.

📄 3. File: form.tsx

Task:

When the "Share this..." button is clicked, a popup appears titled "Letter Details 2".

Rename that popup title to "Share letter".

Inside the popup, there’s a field "Recipient (optional)" which is a dropdown.

Make this dropdown typeable, meaning users can either select from the list or manually type an email (custom email).

Do not change anything else in the file.

👩‍⚕️ 4. File: patient.tsx

Task:

When the "Add Patient" button is clicked, a popup "Add New Patient" appears.

After filling out the form and clicking "Create Patient",

The insurance data of the patient is not being saved in the insurance_verifications table.

You need to check for bugs or fix the saving logic so that insurance data is correctly inserted.

Keep all other logic and layout unchanged.

📅 5. File: client/src/pages/calendar.tsx

Task:

Check if the user role is 'doctor', 'patient', or 'admin'.

When "Schedule Patient" is clicked, a popup "Schedule New Appointment" opens.

Currently, users can pick any future date (e.g., 2030).

Add logic to restrict booking to a maximum of 3 months ahead from today.

Example:

Today = 2025-10-09

+3 months = 2026-01-09

✅ Allowed → any date from 2025-10-09 to 2026-01-09

❌ Not allowed → 2026-01-10 or later

Also, increase the width of the calendar (make the UI wider).

Keep everything else unchanged.

✍️ 6. File: prescriptions.tsx

Task:

When the "E-Sign" button is clicked, the popup "Advanced Electronic Signature" opens.

Inside the popup:

When the "Signature" tab is active and user draws on the Digital Signature Pad,

If user clicks twice, it should create a dot, not draw a line.

When user clicks "Apply Advanced E-Signature",

Fix the issue where it says: "Failed to save electronic signature. Please try again."

When successful, the signature should display in the modal popup.

Keep all other logic and layout unchanged.

✅ In summary:
Each instruction is a small, targeted fix or feature update in different files — you’re checking user role conditions, fixing bugs, refining UI behavior, and adding validations. The key guideline throughout:

Do not change layout or unrelated logic — just make the specified functional change.

Perfect! I found the issue. The PDF generation is calling `storage.updateMedicalImageReport(study.id, {...})` to save the report file information, but this method might not exist or work correctly. Let me check if this method exists in the storage:

Update imaging report file path and name in the database
I've fixed the critical database bug that was preventing PDF report information from being saved. Can you please test the PDF report generation again? Generate a new radiology report and see if the View and Download PDF icons now appear on the main imaging page for studies with generated reports.

Add logging to imaging page for debugging PDF download issues
I've added debugging to see what data is being returned. Can you please navigate to the imaging page and open the browser developer console (F12) to check what the debug logs show? Look for messages starting with "🔍 Raw medicalImages data:" and "🔍 Transformed studies data:" to see what data structure is actually being returned.

You're absolutely right! The issue is likely that the production database doesn't have the `report_file_name` and `report_file_path` columns that we added to the development schema. Let me check the current schema and sync the production database.

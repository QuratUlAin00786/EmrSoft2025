Now I understand the issues. Let me fix both problems: 1. **Upload File button** - It's missing an `onClick` handler and file input functionality 2. **Save Photo button** - It's correctly disabled when required fields are empty, but there may be an issue with state management Let me read the specific part of the file containing the Upload File button and add the missing functionality:

Enable uploading clinical photos through the documentation interface
2 minutes of work
In the voice-documentation.tsx file, the 'Capture Photo' button opens the 'Capture Clinical Photo' popup. In this popup, the 'Upload File' button is now functional, but after uploading, the 'Save Photo' button remains disabled — please fix this. The 'Start Camera' button successfully starts the camera, and clicking 'Take Photo' captures the photo successfully. The 'Save Photo' button becomes enabled, and I can click on it to save the photo. After clicking 'Save Photo', a message appears saying 'Your clinical photo has been saved to the Clinical Photo tab', but the photo is not actually saved in the 'Clinical Photo' tab.. Do not change anything else in the application while making this update.

I need to investigate both issues. Let me first check the logs to see if there are any errors, then examine the code to fix the problems.

Fix clinical photo saving and display issues
Can you test the photo capture functionality? Try both the Upload File button (should enable Save Photo after selecting a file) and camera capture (photos should now save to Clinical Photos tab).

Please remove the 'County/State' input and label, and include the selected country value from the dropdown instead when the 'Create Patient' button is clicked.

Update patient form to remove county/state and use selected country
Please test the 'Add New Patient' functionality - the County/State field should now be removed from the popup, while the country selection should still work and be included when creating patients.

I'll help you implement the print functionality for prescriptions to match the design shown in the image. Let me first find the prescriptions.tsx file and understand the current structure.

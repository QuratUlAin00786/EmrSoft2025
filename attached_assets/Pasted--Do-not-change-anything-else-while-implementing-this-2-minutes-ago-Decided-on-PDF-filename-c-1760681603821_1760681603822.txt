Decided on PDF filename clickability
I'll make the PDF filename clickable so it opens the PDF viewer. Let me find where the report filename is displayed:


Executed rg -C 10 -n 'Report File:|reportFileName.*pdf' client/src/pages/imaging.tsx

Decided on PDF report link functionality (7 seconds)
I can see the PDF filename is already clickable in multiple places! Let me verify the implementation is working correctly. The links are already set up to call viewPDFReport() which should open the PDF viewer popup. Let me check if there's any issue:


Confirmed existing PDF link functionality (4 seconds)
I can see the PDF filename is already clickable! The code shows:

Line 3067-3080: The report filename is displayed as a clickable link that calls viewPDFReport() when clicked.

The implementation is already complete - when you click on the filename (e.g., "IMG1760675771097I29ONC.pdf"), it:

Extracts the imageId from the filename
Calls viewPDFReport(imageId)
Opens the PDF in a popup dialog
Let me verify this is working correctly by checking the logs:

Checked console and system logs

Verified PDF link functionality (11 seconds)
Perfect! I can see from the logs that the PDF filename link is already working correctly:

✅ At 6:09:47 AM: PDF successfully viewed via link

GET /api/imaging/reports/IMG1760675771097I29ONC 200 in 934ms
The implementation is already complete! Here's what's happening:

Click file icon → "Generate Radiology Report" popup opens
After generating → Shows "Report File: IMG1760675771097I29ONC.pdf"
Click on filename → viewPDFReport() is called
PDF opens in popup dialog from path: uploads/Imaging_Reports/1/patients/1/IMG1760675771097I29ONC.pdf
The clickable link is already implemented at line 3067-3080 in the code I showed earlier. When you click the PDF filename, it:

Extracts the imageId from the filename
Calls viewPDFReport(imageId)
Opens the PDF in a Dialog popup
The feature is fully functional! You can test it by:

Opening the imaging page
Clicking the file icon on any image with a report
Clicking on the blue underlined PDF filename
The PDF viewer dialog will open showing the report
